# High-level backend development is an open problem

There are multiple approaches to develop a backend/API to your Web or Mobile app nowadays.
My goal here is to structure and categorize them to hopefully get a more precise picture
on what is going on here.

In 2020 there's no obvious way to approach API building. Like in 2012 it was still believed by many
that REST can be implemented "correctly" to "solve all our problems". It couldn't be further
from the truth but there was hope at least. Not anymore. Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Google and many
other teams tried-and-discarded the very idea of REST layers/hierarchy as something worthy.

One of the key ideas of REST (documentation should be somehow tied to data) was viable but approached 
from an entirely wrong angle. Bloating your HTTP with unrequested links and metadata, from the present, 
looks almost insane. This was solved by GraphQL (among other key points) in kinda the opposite way to what was originally proposed
by Roy Fielding. It's easy to judge with a hindsight, of course, but the point is: GraphQL is a drop-in REST replacemend with mostly pros and no cons.

So what next? Many original questions on how to approach API remain and new ones keep emerging. 
"The perfect API" now looks less achievable then ever, despite all the collective effort of scientists, engineers, programmers and all the other.

TODO: redefine pros and cons per vendor, not per category. Many of pros and cons are vendor-specific.
Also categorization is unsolvable in general as most popular vendors are quite unique in their feature sets.

### ðŸ”® 0. Previous state of the art in REST

#### Examples

ðŸ‘‰ [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=ru)<br/>
Used to be considered expensive, now is fine in comparison ;) Realtime out of the box.<br/>
Limited filtering and data-modelling capabilities.

#### Pros & Cons

&plusmn; Automatic REST API<br/> 
&minus; Performance (too many queries)<br/> 
&minus; Ergonomics (no static typing => no precise docs, nothing like GraphiQL, etc)<br/> 
&minus; N+1 problem: Dataloader helps with Child &rarr; Parent, fails in Parent &rarr; Child (filtering is pushed from DB to App)<br/> 

### ðŸ”® 1. Custom GraphQL API

#### Examples

ðŸ‘‰ [Apollo-Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) + [Dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader)<br/>
Pretty good and intuitive tools.

#### Pros & Cons

&plusmn; Custom GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)<br/>
&minus; Custom Migrations<br/>
&minus; GraphQL to SQL is too complex to inline in your business logic<br/>
&minus; N+1 problem: Dataloader helps with Child &rarr; Parent, fails in Parent &rarr; Child (filtering is pushed from DB to App)<br/>
&plus; Single API layer<br/>
&plus; Deployment freedom<br/>

### ðŸ”® 2. Runtime GraphQL Query &rarr; Relational Query

#### Examples

ðŸ‘‰ [Join-Monster](https://github.com/join-monster/join-monster)<br/> 
Seems abandoned. Only basic sorting! Slow, according to feedback. :|

ðŸ‘‰ [SQLMancer](https://github.com/danielrearden/sqlmancer)<br/>
Draft state. Going for a full rewrite a.t.m :|

#### Pros & Cons

&plusmn; Custom GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)<br/>
&minus; Custom Migrations<br/>
&plus; no N+1 and derivative problems<br/>
&plus; Single API layer<br/>
&plus; Deployment freedom<br/>
&minus; Performance (runtime query parsing is expensive)<br/> 
&minus; Performance (potential drops for join-heavy cases)<br/> 

### ðŸ”® 3. Runtime GraphQL Query &rarr; Graph Query

#### Examples 

ðŸ‘‰ [Neo4J-GraphQL-JS](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js) (GraphQL &rarr; Cypher)<br/>
Draft state.

#### Pros & Cons

&plusmn; Custom GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)<br/>
&minus; Custom Migrations<br/> 
&plus; No N+1 and derivative problems<br/>
&plus; Single API layer<br/>
&plus; Deployment freedom<br/>
&minus; Performance (runtime query parsing is expensive)<br/> 
&plus; Performance (no joins, graphs!)<br/> 
 
### ðŸ”® 4. Relational DB &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

ðŸ‘‰ [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/)<br/>
Interesting project, many unique ideas. Small team â€“ slow progress.

ðŸ‘‰ [subZero](https://subzero.cloud/)<br/>
Kinda like cloud-only PostGraphile. Doesn't look like in active development.

ðŸ‘‰ [Super-Graph](https://github.com/dosco/super-graph)<br/>
Basic API generator. Written in Go (can be &plusmn;).

#### Pros & Cons

&plusmn; Automagic GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)<br/>
&plus; Takes care of Migrations<br/>
&plus; No N+1 and derivative problems<br/>
&minus; API can't be derived from tables in general. Requires an extra API layer and many meta-data hints in DB.<br/>
&plus; Deployment freedom<br/>
&minus; Performance (runtime query parsing is expensive)<br/> 
&minus; Performance (potential drops for join-heavy cases)<br/> 

### ðŸ”® 5. Graph DB &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

Not aware of any

#### Pros & Cons

???

### ðŸ”® 6. Prisma

[Prisma](https://prisma.io/) is a high-level, database-agnostic, typescript-friendly ORM + Migration tool + Data UI. 
Generates a typed DB client from DSL models and migrations from DSL model diffs. Reusable TS types are also generated. CLI experience is pretty good with helpful error messages. API is also good: properly typed, autocompletion works. I've noticed some bugs, e.g. I have to restart IDE (Webstorm) to pick the correct types after a migration. Data UI is way too simplistic a.t.m and should not be considered a feature. So basically it's a good ORM + migration tool + ecosystem so far.
Ecosystem: Nexus, Amplication, Prismal Platform (cloud). 

#### Pros & Cons

&plus; Mid-level, typed DB handling.<br/>
&minus; Yet another DSL, adds to the "model/type" DRY fatique. Does not generate API layer by itself. There're experimental projects (Nexus, etc) allowing to derive API from Prisma DSL but they are too immature and incomplete (and rely on another codegen layer ðŸ˜ž) a.t.m.<br/>

### ðŸ”® 7. Relational DB &larr; Custom Data via UI &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

ðŸ‘‰ [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/).<br/>
Good UI. Kinda buggy. Pretty expensive at the moment.<br/>

&plusmn; Automagic GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)<br/>
&plus; Takes care of Migrations<br/> 
&plusmn; Performance (potential drops for join-heavy queries)<br/>
&plus; Single API layer in simple cases<br/>
&minus; Extra API layer in other cases<br/>

### ðŸ”® 8. Relational DB &larr; GraphQL Types &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

ðŸ‘‰ [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)<br/>
Interesting project. Seem to know their stuff. Got >100M investments...<br/>
Gains traction recently. Good docs in comparison, many examples, established a community.<br/>

&plusmn; Automagic GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)<br/>
&plus; Takes care of Migrations<br/> 
&plus; Single API layer in simple cases<br/>
&plusmn; Performance (potential drops for join-heavy queries)<br/>
&plus; Autogenerated CMS<br/>
&minus; Extra API layer in other cases<br/>
&plus; Deployment freedom<br/>
&minus; Pretty expensive at the moment<br/>

### ðŸ”® 9. Graph DB &larr; GraphQL Types &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

ðŸ‘‰ [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/)<br/>
Looks promising. Very limited filtering and sorting capabilities.<br/>
Supports two languages: FQL (main) and GraphQL (basic, beta).<br/> 
Promise to add even more languages (instead of focusing) :shrug:<br/> 

#### Pros & Cons

&plusmn; Automagic GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)<br/>
&plus; Takes care of Migrations<br/> 
&plus; Distributed transactions<br/>
&plus; Performance (single GQL query = single DB query)<br/>
&plus; Single API layer in simple cases<br/>
&minus; Extra API layer in other cases<br/>
&minus; Extra language to learn (FQL)<br/>

### ðŸ”® 10. GraphQL-speaking DBs

#### Examples

ðŸ‘‰ [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/)<br/>
Looks promising. Sparse docs. Supports two languages: GraphQL&plusmn; vs GraphQL.<br/>
The question of which-to-use-when is not addressed in docs :shrug:

#### Pros & Cons

&plusmn; Automagic GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)<br/>
&plus; Distributed transactions<br/>
&plus; Performance (single GQL query = single DB query)<br/>
&plus; Single API layer in simple cases<br/>
&minus; Extra API layer in other cases<br/>
&minus; Potential performance loss for cross API roundtrips (e.g. Dgraph permission resolving)<br/>

## Honorable Mentions

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) is a Firebase rival. RESTp & GraphQL API & SDK. TypeScript support is [WIP](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues/170). File uploads. No aggregation queries.
- [NHost](https://nhost.io/) is built on top of Hasura, Hasura-Auth and S3. No self-hosting option. Barebone docs, URQL support is not documented [a.t.m](https://issuehint.com/issue/nhost/nhost/271)
- [AppWrite](https://appwrite.io/) is another Firebase rival. Does not support GraphQL [a.t.m](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/discussions/1280)
- [Amplication](https://amplication.com/) is an API & Auth code generator (GraphQL and REST). Models can be created in UI and CLI (imperatively :thinking:)
(reconsider if switches to DSL)
