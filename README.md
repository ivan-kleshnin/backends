# High-level backend development is an open-problem

There are multiple approaches to develop a backend/API to your Web or Mobile app nowadays.
My goal here is to structure and categorize them to hopefully get a more precise picture
on what is going on here.

In 2020 there's no obvious way to approach API building. Like in 2012 it was still believed by many
that REST can be implemented "correctly" to "solve all our problems". It couldn't be further
from the truth but there was hope at least. Not anymore. Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Google and many
other teams tried-and-discarded the very idea of REST layers/hierarchy as something worthy.

One of the key ideas of REST (documentation should be somehow tied to data) was viable but approached 
from an entirely wrong angle. Bloating your HTTP with unrequested links and metadata, from the present, 
looks almost insane. This was solved by GraphQL (among other key points) in kinda the opposite way to what was originally proposed
by Roy Fielding. It's easy to judge with a hindsight, of course, but the point is: GraphQL is a drop-in REST replacemend with mostly pros and no cons.

So what next? Many original questions on how to approach API remain and new ones keep emerging. 
"The perfect API" now looks less achievable then ever, despite all the collective effort of scientists, engineers, programmers and all the other.

Note: some of the following pros and cons are probably vendor- and not category-specific. It's very hard if even possible to completely separate one from another.

### ðŸ”­ 0. Previous state of the art in REST

#### Examples

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=ru)<br/>
Used to be considered expensive, now seems fine in comparison ;) Realtime out of the box.

#### Pros & Cons

&plus; Automatic REST API
&minus; Performance (too many queries)
&minus; Ergonomics (no static typing => no precise docs, nothing like GraphiQL, etc)
&minus; N+1 problem: Dataloader helps with Child &rarr; Parent, fails in Parent &rarr; Child (filtering is pushed from DB to App)

### ðŸ”­ 1. Custom GraphQL API

#### Examples

[Apollo-Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) + [Dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader)<br/>
A pretty good and intuitive tool.

#### Pros & Cons

&plusmn; Custom GraphQL API (magic vs boilerplate)
&plusmn; Custom Migrations (magic vs boilerplate)
&minus; N+1 problem: Dataloader helps with Child &rarr; Parent, fails in Parent &rarr; Child (filtering is pushed from DB to App)
&plus; No extra API layer in simple cases<br/>
&plus; Deployment freedom<br/>

### ðŸ”­ 2. Runtime GraphQL Query &rarr; Relational Query

#### Examples

- [Join-Monster](https://github.com/join-monster/join-monster)<br/> 
Seems abandoned. Only basic sorting! Slow, according to feedback. :|

- [SQLMancer](https://github.com/danielrearden/sqlmancer)<br/>
Draft state. Going for a full rewrite a.t.m :|

#### Pros & Cons

TODO describe

### ðŸ”­ 3. Runtime GraphQL Query &rarr; Graph Query

#### Examples 

- [Neo4J-GraphQL-JS](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js) (GraphQL &rarr; Cypher)<br/>
...

#### Pros & Cons

TODO describe
 
### ðŸ”­ 4. Relational DB &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

- [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/)<br/>
...

- [subZero](https://subzero.cloud/)<br/>
...

- [Super-Graph](https://github.com/dosco/super-graph)<br/>
...

#### Pros & Cons

TODO describe 

### ðŸ”­ 5. Graph DB &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

Not aware of any

#### Pros & Cons

TODO describe 

### ðŸ”­ 6. Relational DB &larr; Custom Code &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

- [Prisma + ecosystem](https://www.prisma.io/)<br/>
...I have little idea what Prisma-2 is and what is provides. They are constantly changing their focus so I lost the track and interest :(

#### Pros & Cons

TODO describe

### ðŸ”­ 7. Relational DB &larr; Custom Data via UI &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

- [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/).<br/>
...

&plus; Automatic GraphQL API
&plus; Takes care of Migrations
&plusmn; Performance (potential drops for join-heavy queries)<br/>
&plus; No extra API layer in simple cases<br/>
&minus; Extra API layer in other cases<br/>
&minus; Pretty expensive at the moment<br/>

### ðŸ”­ 8. Relational DB &larr; GraphQL Types &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)<br/>
...

&plus; Automatic GraphQL API
&plus; Takes care of Migrations
&plus; No extra API layer in simple cases<br/>
&plusmn; Performance (potential drops for join-heavy queries)<br/>
&minus; Extra API layer in other cases<br/>

### ðŸ”­ 9. Graph DB &larr; GraphQL Types &rarr; GraphQL API

#### Examples

- [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/)<br/>
Very limited filtering and sorting capabilities.

#### Pros & Cons

&plus; Automatic GraphQL API
&plus; Takes care of Migrations
&plus; Distributed transactions<br/>
&plus; Performance (single GQL query = single DB query)<br/>
&plus; No extra API layer in simple cases<br/>
&minus; Extra API layer in other cases<br/>
&minus; Extra language to learn (FQL)<br/>

### ðŸ”­ 10. GraphQL-speaking DBs

#### Examples

- [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/)<br/>
...

#### Pros & Cons

&plus; Automatic GraphQL API
&plus; Distributed transactions<br/>
&plus; Performance (single GQL query = single DB query)<br/>
&plus; No extra API layer in simple cases<br/>
&minus; Extra API layer in other cases<br/>
&minus; Potential performance loss for cross API roundtrips (e.g. Dgraph permission resolving)<br/>
